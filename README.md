# halo-3-recomp

An in-progress static recompilation of Halo 3 (Xbox 360) to native PC code,
with decompilation of individual subsystems as a long-term goal.

**No game data is included.** You need your own legally dumped copy of the
game. See [docs/DUMPING.md](docs/DUMPING.md).

## How it works

1. [XenonRecomp](https://github.com/hedge-dev/XenonRecomp) translates every
   PowerPC function in the game's `default.xex` into C++
   (`H3RecompLib/ppc/`, generated and git-ignored).
2. The runtime (`H3Recomp/`) provides what the 360 used to: guest memory,
   kernel/XAM imports, graphics, audio, input.
3. Over time, recompiled functions get replaced with hand-written code.

This is the same approach as [Unleashed Recompiled](https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp),
which is the best reference for what a finished runtime looks like.
[Xenia](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia) is the reference for kernel
and GPU behaviour.

## Layout

```
H3Recomp/            runtime: entry point, guest memory, kernel imports
H3RecompLib/config/  XenonRecomp config + jump tables for Halo 3
H3RecompLib/ppc/     generated C++ (ignored)
tools/h3xexinfo/     XEX inspector: layout, imports, helper addresses, stubs
tools/recompile.sh   full XEX -> C++ pipeline
thirdparty/          XenonRecomp (submodule)
private/             your game files (ignored)
docs/                dumping guide, roadmap
```

## Building

Requires CMake 3.20+, Ninja and Clang 18+.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Tools only (no game files needed)
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release

# Put your default.xex in private/, then:
build/release/tools/h3xexinfo/h3xexinfo private/default.xex
# paste the printed addresses into H3RecompLib/config/halo3.toml
tools/recompile.sh
cmake --build --preset release
build/release/H3Recomp/H3Recomp private/default.xex
```

Set `H3_STRICT_IMPORTS=1` to abort on the first unimplemented kernel import
instead of logging it and returning 0.

## Status

Skeleton. See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
